React Tree View Recursive Example
==================================

This is a sample of Recursive Tree View Component for ReactJS

There is [great example](https://github.com/chenglou/react-treeview) of Tree View made by [chenglou](https://github.com/chenglou). However his approach requires to know the level of tree in advance. 

If you for example need to display server-created category tree from API response, a recursive approach come handy.  

Check the simple demo displaying following tree:

Root (0)
|   +-- A (1)
|   +-- B (2)
|   |   +-- C (3)
|   |   +-- D (4)
|   |   |   +-- E (5)
|   |   +-- F (6)
|   |   |   +-- G (7)
