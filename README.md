React TreeView Recursive Example
==================================

Can be the React component recursive? Why not, after all it's JavaScript function. This repo contains a sample of Recursive TreeView Component.

There is well known [example](https://github.com/chenglou/react-treeview) of Tree View made by [chenglou](https://github.com/chenglou). It works quite good, but only if you know the level of your tree in advance. 

This example on the other hand can handle the data more dynamically.  Check the demo with two example trees.

## If you want to test it localy, simply clone the repo.

Run:  
```
npm install
npm start
```

Check your http://localhost:3000/
